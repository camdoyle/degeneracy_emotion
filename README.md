Degenerate Neural Representations of Emotion
=======

This project uses the GIMME algorithm (Gates et al. 2017) to investigate degeneracy in the neural representation of emotion. The analyses conducted for this project contributed to Cameron Doyle's dissertation document, as well as a manuscript that will be resubmitted to _Human Brain Mapping_.
